            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To be absolutely clear, here's a list of what DailyQuote <span class="font-bold">does not</span> gather from you or your device:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><span class="font-medium">Personal Identifiable Information (PII):</span> This includes your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other data that could identify you personally.</li>
                <li><span class="font-medium">Usage Data:</span> We do not track how you use the app, which quotes you view, how long you spend on the app, or any other interaction data.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Why No Data?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The DailyQuote app is designed to be a simple, standalone source of daily wisdom. Its core functionality—displaying a new quote each day—does not require any user data to operate. We believe that a truly focused and private experience is the best experience.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This means you can enjoy your daily dose of inspiration with complete peace of mind, knowing your privacy is fully respected.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                DailyQuote does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or other services that would collect data from our users. Our commitment to no data collection extends to our lack of reliance on external data-gathering tools.

                DailyQuote is not directed at children under the age of 13. Given that we do not collect any personal data from any users, the privacy of children is inherently protected by our no-data policy.
